Fleximatecher HTTP interface
============================

This project aims to provide a comfortable interface to the Fleximatcher top down parser.

Roadmap
-------

The following functions are to be implemented:

* parse a text and return the corresponding annotations ✓
* add new annotations ✓
* define annotations using HTTP ✓
* generate text from patterns ✓
* explicitly explain all the steps leading to a parse result ✓
* give said steps in a human-readable report (not a JSON) ☐
* export and import all the rules in a single file ✓
* return statistics on the average parse duration and the usage of the different tags ☐
* define parsers using Javascript ☐
