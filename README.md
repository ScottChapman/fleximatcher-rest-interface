Fleximatecher HTTP interface
============================

This project aims to provide a comfortable interface to the Fleximatcher top down parser.

Roadmap
-------

The following functions are to be implemented:

* parse a text and return the corresponding annotations ✓
* add new annotations ☐ (partial, available in the old version and now only in the embedded TSV loader, present in the underlining library)
* define annotations using HTTP (with Apache Stanbol? It would be the best) ☐
* return statistics on the average parse duration and the usage of the tool
* define parsers using Javascript
